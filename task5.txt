z-index is a CSS property that determines the stacking order of elements in the vertical (z-axis) direction.
 It's like arranging elements in layers, with higher z-index values appearing above those with lower values.

example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <style>
    .box1 {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: red;
      position: absolute;
      top: 50px;
      left: 50px;
      z-index: 2;
    }

    .box2 {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: blue;
      position: absolute;
      top: 80px;
      left: 80px;
      z-index: 1;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <div class="box1"></div>
  <div class="box2"></div>

</body>
</html>

In this example, we have two boxes (box1 and box2) positioned absolutely on the page.
box1 has a higher z-index than box2 (2 vs. 1).
As a result, box1 will appear above box2 because it's in a higher layer on the z-axis.
You can think of z-index like layers in a stack. Higher values are on top of lower values.
